        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">International Lecture: Using Genetics to Meet the Food Demand of 2050</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 4, 2025<br/><strong>Venue:</strong> Aliyu Akwe Doma Indoor Theatre, Naraguta Campus, University of Jos</p>

        <p>The TETFUND Centre of Excellence in Food Security (TCoEFS), University of Jos, in collaboration with the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Jos, hosted a landmark international lecture on "Using Genetics to Meet the Food Demand of 2050."</p>

        <p>The keynote speaker, Dr. Bob Weaber, Professor of Animal Science and Extension Specialist at Kansas State University, delivered a thought-provoking lecture that examined the potential of genetics and genomic technologies in addressing global food security challenges. The lecture also featured Dr. Martin Sieber, President and CEO of the US Livestock Genetic Export (USLGE), a key partner institution.</p>

        <p>The event attracted a wide range of participants, including university leadership, academics, researchers, postgraduate students, industry stakeholders, policymakers, and development partners.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Participation Overview</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Physical Attendance: 311 participants</li>
          <li>Virtual Attendance: 41 participants</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This hybrid format enabled broad engagement, bringing together diverse stakeholders in food systems, animal breeding, and agricultural policy.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Lecture Highlights</h3>
        <p>Dr. Weaber stressed that with the world's population projected to surpass 9.7 billion by 2050, achieving food security will require science-led approaches. He argued that animal genetics and genomic innovations must become central pillars in global strategies to ensure sustainable and resilient food systems.</p>

        <p>Key themes from the lecture included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Genetic selection for livestock breeds adaptable to diverse and changing environments.</li>
          <li>Enhancing reproductive efficiency, feed conversion ratios, and disease resistance.</li>
          <li>Deploying strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity in livestock systems.</li>
          <li>Building climate-resilient, economically efficient livestock systems that balance productivity with sustainability.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>According to Dr. Weaber, advancing breeding technologies and scaling their adoption in African livestock systems will be critical to safeguarding future food security. He described genetics as a "cornerstone for the sustainability of meat and dairy production in the coming decades."</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Policy and Research Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Dr. Weaber presented a practical roadmap for integrating genetics into African food and livestock systems. Recommendations included:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Developing national breeding schemes adapted to local ecosystems and farming realities.</li>
          <li>Establishing comprehensive animal performance databases to inform decision-making.</li>
          <li>Expanding crossbreeding and genomic selection programmes to improve resilience and productivity.</li>
          <li>Training extension personnel and researchers in modern genetic tools and methodologies.</li>
          <li>Building commercial-scale farms as anchors for research uptake, innovation diffusion, and farmer adoption.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Institutional Engagement</h3>

        <p>The third day of the Four-Day Capacity Building Workshop of the TETFund Centre of Excellence in Food Security (TCoEFS), University of Jos, held on Wednesday, 24th September 2025, was dedicated to strategic planning, implementation review, and Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs). The day's activities combined field engagement, technical sessions, and practical planning designed to translate the workshop's insights into actionable outcomes.</p>

        <p>The programme began with a field visit to the Miango Rest Home (MRH) Farm, where participants observed ongoing vegetable production and irrigation systems. The MRH Manager explained that the farm had successfully built a small dam for year-round water supply, supporting sustainable crop production. Professor Adeboye O. Fafiolu, one of the workshop's resource persons, commended the innovation and recommended that TCoEFS collaborate with MRH to establish a battery cage fish farming system (fish cage culture) in the dam. He noted that such a partnership would strengthen the Centre's demonstration capacity and create an additional income-generating stream.</p>

        <p>In response, the Director, Professor Dauda Bitrus Bawa, welcomed the proposal and expressed readiness to draft a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with MRH to formalize the partnership.</p>

        <p>Returning to the plenary session, Dr. Comfort Ochepo, the TETFund Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Representative, led a comprehensive review of the TCoEFS Implementation Plan (2021‚Äì2025). She noted that while the Centre had developed a sound strategic framework, progress in execution remained limited, with only a few months left before the plan's expiration in December 2025.</p>

        <p>Dr. Ochepo emphasized the need for practical, time-bound, and measurable actions aligned with the TETFund performance framework. She urged the Centre to focus on activities that can deliver visible results within the short term, particularly in greenhouse farming, poultry rearing, short course development, and postgraduate programme initiation.</p>

        <p>Her specific recommendations included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Commencing bell pepper production in the greenhouse, targeting harvest by December 2025;</li>
          <li>Launching the poultry project with clear management and tracking systems;</li>
          <li>Compiling and advertising short professional courses aligned with agricultural innovation and food security;</li>
          <li>Developing curricula for at least three postgraduate programmes, ensuring prompt approval by the School of Postgraduate Studies;</li>
          <li>Improving the Centre's website visibility and branding to enhance its professional outlook; and</li>
          <li>Encouraging staff to publish under the Centre's name to boost academic visibility and recognition.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Participants also engaged in practical group sessions to align their thematic areas with the DLI framework. The day ended with the drafting of specific timelines and monitoring mechanisms to ensure accountability in implementation.</p>

        <p>Overall, Day Three was marked by deep reflection and strategic planning, with participants acknowledging the urgency of achieving measurable progress. The Centre's leadership reaffirmed its commitment to meeting key deliverables before December 2025 and to sustaining momentum toward institutional excellence and sustainability.</p>

        <p>The first day focused on team building, situational analysis, and establishing a shared vision for the Centre. Participants engaged in interactive sessions that examined TCoEFS's current strengths, identified gaps, and explored opportunities for institutional advancement.</p>

        <p>Group exercises encouraged cross-disciplinary collaboration, breaking down silos between thematic areas and fostering a unified approach to the Centre's mandate in teaching, research, and community service.</p>

        <p>The workshop continues through Thursday, 25th September, with subsequent days focusing on strategic planning, industry partnerships, DLI implementation, and action plan development.</p>
