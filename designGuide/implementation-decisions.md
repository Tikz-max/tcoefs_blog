## Selected Variations

### Homepage: V1 - Classic Magazine Layout ✓

**Why This Choice:**
- Prioritizes content hierarchy with a clear featured post
- Grid layout creates natural scanning patterns (like clearings in a forest)
- Balances information density with breathing room
- Professional yet approachable
- Easy to scan while maintaining engagement

**Alignment with Style Guide:**
- **Warmth:** Cards with soft borders and gentle hover effects create approachable feel
- **Simplicity:** Clean 3-column grid (responsive to 2-col, 1-col) avoids visual chaos
- **Clarity:** Clear distinction between featured and recent content
- **Organic Spacing:** Consistent 24px gaps between cards, generous padding (48px desktop, 24px mobile)
- **Color Usage:** White cards on sage background with light sage borders maintain ecosystem
- **Typography:** Clear hierarchy with featured post using larger text (38px) vs recent posts (24px)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Featured post receives visual priority (larger card, more excerpt text)
- Grid creates natural rhythm and predictable structure
- Hover states (-translate-y-1, shadow elevation) feel organic, not mechanical

- Author card emphasizes human connection
- Related articles with images encourage continued exploration

**Alignment with Style Guide:**
- **Content is Sacred:** Max-width 800px article body for optimal line length

- **Typography Hierarchy:** 
  - Hero title: 5xl (desktop) / 4xl (mobile)
  - Lead paragraph: 22px with medium weight (invites reader in)
  - Body: 19px/32px line-height (optimal readability)
  - Pull quotes: 28px centered in sage background boxes (visual pause)
- **Organic Flow:** Hero → Featured Image → Lead → Body → Pull Quotes → Tags → Author → Related
- **Color Harmony:** Pull quotes use sage background (#d9e8e0), tags have white bg with sage borders

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Organic Minimalism
Both selections remove unnecessary elements while maintaining warmth:
- **Homepage:** No decorative elements, content carries the design
- **Article:** Clean canvas lets writing shine, pull quotes provide natural breaks

### 2. Consistent Green Palette
- Background: `#f2f8f5` (soft sage)
- Text: `#0e1d07` (deep forest)
- Primary: `#1e2a1a` (dark evergreen)
- Accent: `#316840` (living green)
- Borders: Light sage variations maintain ecosystem

### 3. Typography as Voice
- Gambarino font (once loaded) provides personality
- Clear hierarchy through size, not color changes
- Generous line-height (1.6-1.8) for sustained reading

### 4. Natural Spacing System
- 8px base unit throughout
- Common values: 24px (standard), 32px (medium), 48px (major)
- No arbitrary spacing — everything follows system

### 5. Smooth Interactions
- Transitions: 180ms (quick) / 220ms (standard)
- Hover effects: Elevation + color change (organic, not mechanical)
- Focus states: 2px accent outline for accessibility

## Why Not the Others?

**Homepage V2 (Minimalist List):** Too sparse for showcasing multiple articles quickly. Better suited for text-focused blogs with less frequent posting.

**Homepage V3 (Editorial Magazine):** More complex with sidebar, newsletter. Good but adds cognitive load compared to straightforward grid.

**Article V1 (Classic Centered):** Good but lacks visual hierarchy of hero section. More traditional blog feel, less editorial.

**Article V2 (Wide with Sidebar):** TOC sidebar excellent for long technical docs, but adds visual complexity. Our content benefits more from immersive reading.

## Implementation Notes

- Both variations share navigation, footer components (DRY principle)
- Mobile-first responsive approach (toggle shows both views)
- All spacing uses Tailwind values matching our 8px system
- Color values use exact hex from style guide
- Transitions match 180ms/220ms specifications
- Border radius: 6-8px (subtle, not overly rounded)
