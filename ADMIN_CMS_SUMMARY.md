## 📋 Setup Checklist

To use the admin CMS, you need to:

1. ✅ **Supabase Setup**
   - Create articles and article_images tables
   - Set up RLS policies
   - Enable authentication

2. ✅ **Cloudinary Setup**
   - Create account (cloud name: `tcoefs`)
   - Create upload preset (`tcoefs`, mode: unsigned)
   - Set asset folder to `tcoefs-news`

3. ✅ **Environment Variables**
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=tcoefs`
   - `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=tcoefs`

4. ✅ **Admin User**
   - Sign up via blog interface
   - Get user UID from Supabase
   - Run SQL to set `role: admin` in user_metadata

5. ✅ **Migrate Existing Articles**
   - Run migration script from browser console
   - Or manually insert via SQL

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Required: Update Frontend**
Currently, the homepage and article view still load from `src/data/blogPosts.js`. You need to update:

1. **Homepage.jsx** - Fetch articles from database instead of static file
2. **ArticleView.jsx** - Fetch article by ID from database
3. **Test thoroughly** before removing static data

### **Optional Enhancements**
- [ ] Add "Images" page to browse all uploaded images
- [ ] Add article preview before publishing
- [ ] Add draft/published status
- [ ] Add bulk actions (delete multiple, etc.)
- [ ] Add rich text WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE, Quill)
- [ ] Add article analytics (views, likes count)
- [ ] Add scheduled publishing
- [ ] Migrate existing images to Cloudinary

## 🐛 Known Issues/Limitations

1. **Migration Not Automatic**: Existing articles must be manually migrated
2. **Static Data Still Used**: Frontend needs updating to use database
3. **Basic Text Editor**: Currently HTML textarea, not WYSIWYG
4. **No Draft System**: Articles are either published or don't exist
5. **No Image Library**: Can't browse previously uploaded images
